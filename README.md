# Digital Portfolio

## Description

In order to succeed and finish this project, I was motivated by my want and need to get better at coding from scratch.

I built this project because I wanted to test my abilities and see what I could create on my own (with help from online resources). I also put my effort into creating it because this is something I want to eventually use as my portfolio for my career so that I may present my skills and products with ease.

The problem that this project solves is my lack of a portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer.

I learned a lot more about how to be efficient with formatting my CSS--specifically regarding my responsive design elements. I also learned a bit more about how to use flex, inline, and inline-block as display values. This project has helped me gain a better understanding of both CSS and HTML and while I'm not entirely knowledgeable on how to work with flex as a feature for my design, I am a little better than I was before!

## Usage

On my digital portfolio site, one can access a brief paragraph about me, my work, and my contact information through the header links. There are also alt tags deployed in the site for those that it may serve.

The deployed application should look something like this:
